## Construction Marketplace Platform

The Kenyan construction industry has seen a significant boom in recent years, driven by rapid urbanization, an expanding middle class, and increased demand for residential and commercial properties. However, this growth comes with its own set of challenges. 

One of the major obstacles faced by contractors, property developers, and homeowners is the inefficiency in sourcing construction materials and finding qualified professionals, such as engineers and interior designers, to complete projects. While various suppliers exist, the process of sourcing quality materials, hiring skilled engineers, and finding expert designers often requires navigating multiple platforms, suppliers, and service providers, creating inefficiencies and delays. The absence of a centralized platform where users can access these services in a seamless manner contributes to an increase in project timelines and costs.

The project will simplify  the process of finding construction materials and professional services for constructions and house renovations.
